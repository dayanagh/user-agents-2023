Webmasters, programmers, scrappers and many others use user agents to be able to identify:
The type of browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, etc.), 
Operating system (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android, etc.) and 
Device (Mobile, Laptop, Computer, Tablet, etc.) 
When visiting a web page or application on a mobile phone, so that the server can provide an appropriate response. 

User agents can also be used to track user activity, block malicious requests, etc.

The source database of these data comes from: https://tarjeta-credito.net/tools/ua/user-agent-2023/
